## About SSHBuddy

SSHBuddy is a terminal user interface (TUI) application for managing SSH connections. It brings together hosts from multiple sources into one unified, keyboard-driven interface with live status indicators and a clean, modern design.

### Key Features

- **Multiple Data Sources**: Combine manual hosts, SSH config entries, and Termix API hosts
- **Live Status**: Real-time ping indicators show which hosts are reachable
- **Keyboard-First**: Every action accessible via keyboard shortcuts
- **Six Themes**: Choose a color scheme that matches your terminal
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows

### Philosophy

SSHBuddy is built on these principles:

**Simplicity**: Complex tasks should be simple. Adding a host, searching, or connecting should take seconds, not minutes.

**Integration**: Work with your existing tools. SSHBuddy reads your SSH config and integrates with external systems rather than replacing them.

**Keyboard-Driven**: Your hands should stay on the keyboard. Every feature is accessible without reaching for the mouse.

**Visual Clarity**: Information should be easy to parse at a glance. Status indicators, source icons, and color coding help you quickly understand your infrastructure.
